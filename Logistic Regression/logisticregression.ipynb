    "## Logistic Regression in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Applications like machine learning and data mining need the use of classification techniques. Data science classification issues make up about 70% of all problems. There are many different classification issues that can be addressed, however logistic regression is frequently used and is an effective regression technique for the *binary classification* issue. *Multinomial classification* is another classification type that addresses problems when the target variable contains members of numerous classes. A well-known example of multi-class classification is the **IRIS** dataset. Creating categories for articles, blogs, and documents is another example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different classification issues, such as spam detection, can be solved using logistic regression. Examples include predicting diabetes, determining if a buyer will buy a specific product or switch to a rival, and determining whether a user will click on a specific marketing link or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most straightforward and widely used Machine Learning techniques for two-class classification is logistic regression. It can serve as the starting point for any binary classification issue and is simple to apply. Its foundational ideas are helpful for deep learning as well. The link between one dependent binary variable and independent variables is described and estimated through logistic regression."

    "## What is Logistic Regression?\n",
    "Logistic regression is a statistical method for predicting binary classes. The outcome or target variable is dichotomous in nature. *Dichotomous* means there are only two possible classes. For example, it can be used for cancer detection problems. It computes the probability of an event occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a special case of linear regression where the target variable is categorical in nature. It uses a log of odds as the dependent variable. Logistic Regression predicts the probability of occurrence of a binary event utilizing a logit function."

    "## Linear Regression Vs. Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression gives you a continuous output, but logistic regression provides a constant output. An example of the continuous output is house price and stock price. Example's of the discrete output is predicting whether a patient has cancer or not, predicting whether the customer will churn. Linear regression is estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) while logistic regression is estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) approach.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Maximum Likelihood Estimation Vs. Least Square Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The MLE is a \"likelihood\" maximization method, while OLS is a distance-minimizing approximation method. Maximizing the likelihood function determines the parameters that are most likely to produce the observed data. From a statistical point of view, MLE sets the mean and variance as parameters in determining the specific parametric values for a given model. This set of parameters can be used for predicting the data needed in a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary Least squares estimates are computed by fitting a regression line on given data points that has the minimum sum of the squared deviations (least square error). Both are used to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model. MLE assumes a joint probability mass function, while OLS doesn't require any stochastic assumptions for minimizing distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sigmoid Function\n",
    "The sigmoid function, also called logistic function gives an ‘S’ shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1. If the curve goes to positive infinity, y predicted will become 1, and if the curve goes to negative infinity, y predicted will become 0. If the output of the sigmoid function is more than 0.5, we can classify the outcome as 1 or YES, and if it is less than 0.5, we can classify it as 0 or NO. The outputcannotFor example: If the output is 0.75, we can say in terms of probability as: There is a 75 percent chance that a patient will suffer from cancer.\n",

    "Because of its efficient and straightforward nature, it doesn't require high computation power, is easy to implement, easily interpretable, and used widely by data analysts and scientists. Also, it doesn't require scaling of features. Logistic regression provides a probability score for observations.\n",

    "## Disadvantages\n",
    "Logistic regression is not able to handle a large number of categorical features/variables. It is vulnerable to overfitting. Also, can't solve the non-linear problem with the logistic regression that is why it requires a transformation of non-linear features. Logistic regression will not perform well with independent variables that are not correlated to the target variable and are very similar or correlated to each other."
